Optical Snail Heart Rate Monitor
==================================

Monitoring physiological variables is crucial in many areas of biology.
It is particularily challenging to monitor physiology of small 
animals whilst minimising interferance, or ideally, in the wild.

Land snails are remarkable animals for their ability to 
enter in dormancy states when the weather becomes too cold (hibernation) or too dry (estivation). 
They can remain several months in these respective states as there 
metabolism dramatically slows down, which reduces their need for food and water.

Recording heart rate of snails could reveal a valuable tool to shed light on the mechanisms 
underlying these exceptional phenomena. In addition, it could help understaning temporal patterns 
of activity and, for instance, foraging and mating strategies.

Garden snails (*Helix aspersa*) are fairly large terrestrial invertebrates (more than 10g for adult)
capable of pulling their own weight several times.
In addition, their shell is stable mineral support where small circuit can simply be glued with, 
presumably, little inconveinience for the snail.
It is possible to observe the heart of young snails, through their thin shell, by eye.
In adult snails, the same observation can be accheived by sending light through the shell.
It should therefore be possible to mesure light attenuation over time in order to infer heart rate.     

For these reasons, land snails seem particularily suited to carrying small
electronic equipment in order to record an important physiological variable.
This project describes an inexpensive and non-invasive device to monitor heart rate of snails.


Project aim
--------------------
The aim of this project is to build a small device that can monitor a snail's heart rate and is small enough tu be carried by a garden snail (*Helix aspersa*).
When sending red light though the bottom of the shell, the moving heart of the snail can be seen.
From this observation, the goal is to fit a low power to red LED on one side of the shell whilst recording the intensity of the transmitted light, using a phototransistor, from the other side.

In order to keep the device lightweight, thin wires will be used to convey analogue signal between the animal an Arduino Uno.
Then, the serial port will be used to communicate data to a computer which will display the signal in real time using an `python` script.

In order to save energy and reduce the amount of heat generated by the LED, the circuit will be powered only shortly before recording data points, and turned off immediately after. 
For this purpose, a digital pin of the Arduino will be used.

Theory
-------------------
TODO 
About the heart of snails...
The fact that it can be recorded through ECG (refs?)

We are going to power the LED with 5v, so we need to add a 68Ω resistor (or 22Ω for a 3V board).
Simultaneously, we will record how much current leaks from the phototransistor, which is function of light intensity.
To do this, we can wire one side to the power. On the other side, in parallel, the analog input and, through a 100kΩ resistor, the ground.


The circuit
----------------------
The circuit in itself is really simple:
![circuit schematic](./img/circuit.png)

Note that the **digital pin 13 is used instead of the 5v pin**. 
This way, we can turn the circuit on and off from the Arduino.


Putting it together
----------------------
The end goal is to build a sort of saddle that can be glued onto the shell, and then plugged to a wire for recording purposes.
View from the bottom, the final product could look like this:

![Saddle, bottom view](./img/fig1.jpg)

And from the top:
![Saddle, top view](./img/fig2.jpg)

In both figures, '`AN`' is for the analogue pin.


General instruction
-----------------------
 
We will use the leads of the resistors, and some wire, as a skeleton for our device.
Therefore, we will wait until the end to cut them.
Soldering the LED and the phototransistor can reveal challenging as both parts are very small.
So, it is recommended to hold them firmly, for instance, using "helping hands".
It is easy to forget that both **LED and PT should face downward** as the light will be transmitted through the shell. 


The LED
--------------

1. Before starting, ensure you can tell cathode and anode of the LED apart. Most "surface mounted LEDs" will have an indication such as a small chip on the `+` side.
2. Solder directly one lead of the 68Ω resistor to the anode of the LED.
3. Cut a short wire (1cm), strip and twist its tip.
4. Solder one extremity of the wire to the cathode.


The Phototransistor (PT)
---------------------------

1. As for the LED, ensure you know the polarity.
2. Cut two short wires (1cm), strip and twist there tips.
3. Solder one extremity of a wire to the anode of the PT.
4. Solder directly one lead of the 100kΩ resistor to the cathode. Leave some space between the anode and the resistor to solder the second wire.
5. Solder the tip of the second wire onto the lead of the resistor; between the resistor and the PT.


Assembling on the PCB header
--------------------------------------------------

1. We cut the PCB headed to leave only tree columns (i.e. 6pins). From a bottom-up view, let us label the pins:

```
A ---  -  --- D
B ---     --- E
C ---  +  --- F
```


2. Solder the wire connected to the LED light on A. That is on the `-` side.
3. Solder the lead of the resistor connected to the LED on C **and F** (i.e. `+` side).
4. Solder the wire connected the anode of the PT to F.
5. Solder the leg of the resistor connected to the PT on A **and D**.
6. Solder the second wire of the PT on E.

Lead
--------------------------------------------------

1. Strip the tips of three long (>30cm) flexible and thin wires.
2. Cut three columns of the PCB socket.
3. Solder each wire to a different pin of the PCB header.
4. Plug the PCB socket on the pins `D`, `E` and `F` of the PCB header.
5. Unsure you can tell which wire is for ground (pin `D`) and and which is for `+` (`F`).

Arduino
-------------------

1. Plug the `+` wire on digital pin 13 — or 5v if you want constant light (see 'Fitting the Circuit' section below).
2. Plug the ground wire on ground.
3. Plug the middle wire on analogue in 1.
4. Compile and upload the code for this project to the Arduino.
5. The LED light should start blinking quickly.

Fitting the Circuit
--------------------------------------------------

This is probably the hardest part of the process.
For this reason, a 4min online video demonstrating this part of the protocol step by step is available online (see 'Supporting Material' section above).

The main steps are:

1. Protect the animal by putting tissue paper on the opening of the shell.
2. Plug the Arduino to the USB port of your computer.
3. Run the `python` program (see 'Code Download' section above). A window should appear and plot the signal in real time (see section '???' below).
4. Plug the circuit on. *Use the 5v pin* instead of the digital pin as it will allow you to see the heart beat much better.
5. At this stage, you should be able to test the circuit by moving objects between PT and LED, and observe variation in the data displayed by the `python` program. 
4. Move the LED on the shell until you see the beating heart.
5. Use blu tac to maintain the circuit on the shell and assess the quality of the signal displayed on your screen.
6. When the signal is satisfying (sharp oscillations of large amplitude), glue PT and LED to the shell.
7. Unplug the circuit, interrupt the `python` program, and wait for the glue to dry.
8. Plug the circuit. This time, **use the analogue pin** as opposed to the 5v.
9. Run the `python` program. In addition to simply disply heart rate, the data can be saved to a text file using the `--out` option  (see section 'Python Code Complementary' below).  

**Important Notes:**

* Use as little glue as possible and avoid touching the foot of the animal with any glue. If you are concerns about toxicity, you may consider alternatives such as dental cement.
* In the video, the PT is close to the heart whilst the LED is on the opposite side. However, the invert setting also works, and may give more reliable result for long term monitoring.

Python Code Complementary 
----------------------------
This project uses `python` programing language for  real time visualisation on a computer screen.
Importantly, `python2`, not `python3`.

1. Install `python2` on your machine
2. Install dependency packages using. You can use `pip`, the python package manager for that:

    ```
    pip install numpy pyserial
    ```
    
3. Install `pygame` ([http://pygame.org/download.shtml])
4. Download the `python` code (see 'Code Download' section above)
5. Open a terminal and run the `python` code. For instance:

    ```
    python serial_monitor.py --port /dev/ttyACM0
    ```
    
    Note that you may need chose a specify a different serial port `--port /MY/PORT/IS/HERE` according to your machine and operating system.
    In addition, other options can be displayed by:
    
    ```
    python serial_monitor.py --help
     ```
     
    For instance, `--out /WHERE/TO/SAVE/THE/data.txt` can be useful.


If you are interested in understanding or adapting this python script, explanations are provided, as comments, within the source code.
