Temperature experiment
========

Aim
------------
study the effect of change in temperature on the heart rate of snails

Null hypothesis: temperature does not affect heart rate


Materials
-------------
* 10 snails per trial (use same or different?)
* Snail backpack (heart rate and temperature monitor)
* Arduino UNO + data recording device
* one snail per box
* incubator at 18, 23 and 28 degrees
* food mix with fungicide
* soil with fungicide (need to be tested)

Protocol
-----------
* install snail backpack on 10 snails
* 12:12 day night cycle
* constant humidity and temperature
* measure for a 4-7 days at 18, 23 and 28 degrees (each one week or all together?)
* analyse data


Snail backpack protocol
------------------------
Heart rate sensor:
* use strong white light to mark the position of the LED and the light sensor
* attach LED lights x3 using superglue
* attach the black frame using superglue
* insert light sensor into the blackframe and test
